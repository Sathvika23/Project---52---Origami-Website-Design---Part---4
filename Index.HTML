                The camel's hump is its most notable feature. However, contrary to popular belief, it isn't used to store water. Instead, the hump stores fat. Healthy camels with significant fat stores can survive without food or water for a couple of weeks.

                Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.
